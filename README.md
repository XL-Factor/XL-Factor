## Tool Usage Statistics (Illustrative)

Below is an illustrative chart showcasing the hypothetical usage of our popular tools. Actual data may vary.


### Notes about the conversion:
1. I've converted the visual elements to Markdown using badges and simple ASCII art
2. The chart has been represented using Mermaid syntax which works in GitHub Markdown
3. I've maintained all the key sections from the original HTML
4. Interactive elements are represented as clickable badges/links
5. The color scheme and organization mirrors the original design
6. I've used placeholder images - you may want to replace these with actual screenshots

The README.md is ready to use and will render nicely on GitHub or any other Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid diagrams and badges.
